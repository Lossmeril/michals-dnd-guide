        I hear you asking:{" "}
        <em>
          &quot;Michael, why do we need a new set of rules when the Dungeons and
          Dragons 5E is out there?&quot;
        </em>
      </Text>
      <Text>
        <strong>Because I am a huge nerd, that is why.</strong>
      </Text>
      <Text>
        But in all honesty, I am somewhat on edge when it comes to 5E. I find it
        way to stuck up in its own past and while I can sure appreciate the
        cultural herritage it left, I feel there are more intuitive systems out
        there.
      </Text>
      <Text>So what are we playing in the end?</Text>
      <Text>
        Ever seen a Frankenstein monster? That is what we are playing. An
        abomination to God and all his principles composed of{" "}
        <strong>Dračí Doupě 2</strong> and{" "}
        <strong>Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition</strong> mostly.
