          &quot;Michael, why do we need a new set of rules when the Dungeons and
          Dragons 5E is out there?&quot;

        <strong>Because I am a huge nerd, that is why.</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3">
        But in all honesty, I am somewhat on edge when it comes to 5E. I find it
        way to stuck up in its own past and while I can sure appreciate the
        cultural herritage it left, I feel there are more intuitive systems out
        there.
